<h1>CSS</h1>

<p>CSS is an abbreviation for Cascading Style 
Sheets. Style sheets are simply text files 
(.css ), composed of lines of code that tell 
browsers how to display an HTML page. 
They give the designer more control over 
the appearance of a webpage by allowing 
to specifically define styles for elements, 
such as fonts, on the page. By using CSS 
one could separate HTML content from its 
appearance, distinguishing style from 
structure.

<h1>There are 3 type of CSS</h1>
<p>1. External style sheet</p>
<p>2. Internal style sheet</p>
<p>3. Inline style</p>

<h2>1. External style sheet</h2>
<P>
When using CSS it is preferable to keep the CSS 
separate from your HTML. Placing CSS in a 
separate file allows the web designer to 
completely differentiate between content 
(HTML) and design (CSS). External CSS is a file 
that contains only CSS code and is saved with a 
".css" file extension. This CSS file is then 
referenced in your HTML using the <link> 
instead of <style>. The <link> tag goes inside the 
head section
</P>
  
<h2>2. Internal style sheet</h2>
<P>
If a single document has a unique style you can 
use internal style sheets. Define internal styles in 
the head section of an HTML page, by using the 
<style> tag
</P>
  
<h2>3. Inline style</h2>
<P>
Use style attribute in the relevant tag. The style attribute can 
contain any CSS property.
